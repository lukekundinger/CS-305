Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial wanted to address security in their program with encryption and authentication. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I was able to accurately determine vulnerabilities in the program using a dependency check. Coding securely is important to protect important data from attackers and establish trust for customers. Software security improves a company's well-being by adding trust and keeping data secure.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was determining false positives to suppress.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Layers of security were increased with enryption and authentification. I would use dependency checks again to determine mitigation techniques. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
A checksum verification was used to test the cipher algorithm. A dependency check was conducted before and after refactoring the code.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
OWASP

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
My ability to deploy an algorithm cipher and use a dependency check.
